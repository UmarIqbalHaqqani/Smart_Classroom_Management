= Quiz with timer =

You can set a timer for your quiz and when the timer ends, the quiz will be submitted automatically. A quiz timer option is very useful for making an online exam or test. So we can call it the WordPress Exam plugin too. 


= Quiz results, scores and data form =

After successful completion of the quiz, you can track from your dashboard your visitors' results, duration, when they start, and when they end the quiz.
We have created a beautiful form and you can choose fields of the form from the dashboard and assign this form to your quiz ( After or Before quiz ) and when the user finishes the quiz you can collect data and have beautiful **statistics** on your dashboard. This data allows you to create your **email and SMS marketing**, which will attract much more users from your specific target.
There are 3 static form fields in the free version` name, email and phone. For more custom fields you need to upgrade to the [Quiz PRO](https://ays-pro.com/wordpress/quiz-maker) version.
Also, results' statistics with **graphs and export functionality** are available only in the Pro version.

If you have an e-commerce website, you can give personalized offers to your clients by creating personality tests and letting them pass. You can **offer different products based on the choices your users made** during the quiz. Earn more income and make your users stay on your websites longer. Check out [How to Create a Personality Test in WordPress](https://ays-pro.com/blog/how-to-create-a-personality-test-in-wordpress) article for more detailed information.

Also, there is a **live preview** feature in the style section in the dashboard, which allows the admin to see every change of options. There is no need to save and go to the front end to see changes in styles. *Have fun!*

= Quiz user restriction =

You can restrict your users by enabling and selecting user roles from the dashboard and only selected users with given roles can pass your quiz. If you don't want to restrict your quiz by role, we have created another opportunity for you, just enable **"Only for logged in users"** option and write some message to non-logged-in users, in this way you can enlarge your community. If your quiz is interesting non-registered users will register on your website for passing the quiz and you will have ultra **traffic** on your website. Please note that by selecting restriction by user roles, the quiz will automatically select only for logged-in users option.

Do you wonder how to create a Math Quiz with hard mathematical equations in WordPress? It is easier than you think.

For adding the math equations just install and activate the mentioned plugin. It is one of the easiest math plugins. With the help of it, you can add as many equations as you need, even if they include several symbols. In this [demo](https://www.mathjax.org/#demo), you can see a step-by-step tutorial on how to use MathJax. You have to be careful to use less-than signs, ampersands, and other HTML special characters within your math equations.
For example, to add a squared symbol, you need to write down the following sign ^2. (do not forget to insert $ character to mark the beginning and ending).
