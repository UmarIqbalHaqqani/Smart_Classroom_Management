BBB requires a hosting server that can be connected to our plugin. Please refer to our [hosting guide](https://elearningevolve.com/blog/hosting-virtual-classroom-for-wordpress/) for setup.

### Virtual Classroom for WordPress Features ###
Virtual Classroom for WordPress enables the user to create BBB rooms right from the WordPress dashboard. Once the room is created it can be added to any WordPress page through a simple shortcode. There is also a possibility to enter multiple rooms in the shortcode to let the user choose the room that they want to join.

The student can simply click Join from the page where the shortcode is added and enter the BBB room where the teacher can initiate a virtual classroom session.

After the session is over the plugin can also display the recording of the session on the same page so that the students can take the keynotes from the session later on.
