== Features of Online Exam Proctoring Plugin ==

ProctoPress, the exam proctoring plugin for WordPress comes with various features that ensure online exam security and integrity of the online assessments. Below mentioned are a few features of the exam proctoring plugin. However, we understand that every business need is different and we do not follow the one-size-fits-all approach. Hence, the plugin can be customized to meet the requirements of any business and exams.


* <strong>Browsing Limitation:</strong> Using ProctoPress, the administrator can lock the exam environment on the screen and impose checks and restrictions on the candidate’s device during the online assessment. If the candidate navigates away from the exam screen, a warning message is displayed. If this behavior exceeds the allowed limits (set by the admin), the candidate will be logged out of the exam automatically. 

* <strong>Disabling Right-Click and Browser Inspection:</strong> Our WordPress online proctoring plugin employs measures to constrain candidates from utilizing the right-click and inspect functionalities during examinations, thereby mitigating the potential for unauthorized access to questions within the inspect section.

* <strong>Session Restriction:</strong> ProctoPress plugin provides a session restriction option that limits users from logging in on multiple devices or browsers simultaneously. The admin can also set the maximum number of simultaneous sessions allowed for a user. If the candidate surpasses the set limit, the admin can allow or disable access. The prior permits the user to log in to the current session while terminating all other sessions, meanwhile the latter prevents the user from logging in until they log out from other devices.

* <strong>Tab Switching Restriction:</strong> Our exam proctoring plugin for WordPress ensures a secure exam environment by restricting candidates from switching tabs during the examination. If a candidate attempts to switch tabs, a warning message is displayed. In the event of repeated tab-switching, as per the pre-defined configuration, the candidate will be automatically logged out of the exam. 

* <strong>Real-time Candidate Monitoring:</strong> The online proctoring plugin provides the admin with the option to monitor the video/audio of the candidates to check for the use of unfair means and other suspicious activity observed during the assessment.

* <strong>Secure Data and Information:</strong> During the examination, the candidates need to share their personal information. The ProctoPress plugin ensures the protection of the data that has been shared by the candidate.

<strong>Premium Features of online exam proctoring</strong> 

Along with the aforementioned features, the ProctoPress premium plugin is loaded with a few extra ones that add to the security and integrity of the exams. The premium features include:

* <strong>Integration with popular LMS plugins:</strong> ProctoPress seamlessly integrates with leading WordPress LMS plugins, including LearnDash, Tutor LMS, LearnPress, MasterStudy LMS, and more. The integration process is streamlined, ensuring compatibility and delivering a highly intuitive and user-friendly experience for users engaging with the learning management features.

* <strong>Real-time Candidate Monitoring:</strong> Our WordPress online proctoring plugin provides the admin with the option to monitor the video/audio of the candidates in real-time to check for the use of unfair means and other suspicious activity observed during the assessment. If the proctor suspects any unusual activity, they have the option to terminate the exam.

* <strong>Candidate Authentication:</strong> Candidate Authentication is a process that is used to verify the user’s identity, to ensure that the user taking the examination is an original candidate and not an impersonator. This feature ensures the authenticity of the candidate. We ensure that the information/data shared by the candidate is protected. 

* <strong>Complete Browser Lock:</strong> Throughout the online exam, our plugin mandates a persistent full-screen mode for candidates. In this mode, browser inspection and right-click functionalities are systematically deactivated. Any attempts by the candidate to exit the full-screen mode trigger an automatic logout for security measures.

* <strong>Advanced Control Features:</strong> Advanced control features are embedded in the Online Exam Proctoring system to detect and flag suspected cheating or misleading activities by candidates. Continuous alerts during the online examination or proctored assessments empower the proctor with the capability to terminate the examination if necessary. Additionally, the system offers the functionality to disable copy-paste during these assessments, enhancing the overall security measures in place.

* <strong>Data Storage And Review:</strong> After the completion of the proctored assessment, live audio and video recordings of the exam are stored in the cloud. This enables administrators to review the sessions at their discretion.
